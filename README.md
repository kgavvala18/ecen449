# Microprocessor System Design Labs

This repository contains lab work on hardware/software co-design using the Zybo Z7-10 FPGA development board

## Course Overview
 
**Labs 1 and 2** Focused on using Verilog HDL for digital circuit design.

**Labs 3-7** involved developing a custom hardware peripheral in Verilog and interfacing through both bare-metal C and embedded Linux using the PetaLinux SDK. 
The embedded Linux approach demonstrated both built-in kernel modules and dynamically loadable kernel modules for driver development.

## Technical Skills Demonstrated
- **FPGA Design:** Verilog HDL, Xilinx Vivado
- **Embedded Linux:** PetaLinux SDK, device tree configuration, kernel development
- **Low-level Programming:** Bare-metal C, memory-mapped I/O, register-level control
- **Driver Development:** Character device drivers, kernel modules, user-space interfaces

## Platform

- **Hardware:** Digilent Zybo Z7-10 FPGA Board
- **Languages:** Verilog HDL, C
