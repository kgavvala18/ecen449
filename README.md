# Microprocessor System Design Labs

This repository contains lab work and documentation from a graduate-level Microprocessor System Design course focused on hardware/software co-design using the Zybo Z7-10 FPGA development board

## Course Overview
 
**Labs 1 and 2** Focused on using verilog HDL for digital circuit design
**Labs 3-7** involved developing a custom hardware peripheral in verilog and interfacing with it through both bare-metal C programming and embedded Linux using the PetaLinux SDK. 
The embedded Linux approach demonstrated both built-in kernel modules and dynamically loadable kernel modules for driver development.

## Platform

- **Hardware:** Digilent Zybo Z7-10 FPGA Board
- **Tools:** Xilinx Vivado, PetaLinux SDK
- **Languages:** Verilog HDL, C
